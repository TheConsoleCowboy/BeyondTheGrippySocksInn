        <h1>9 January 2023 - Looped songs</h1>
        <p>It's been a few days since I last wrote anything on this, then today I ended up not only writing something but publishing 
            the first parts of this project on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 
            <br>
            I think it will be an actual project now... something to work on, something to publish,
            something to share with anyone who may need to hear something like it...
            <br>
            Or no one will read it, and it will just be my crazy ramblings for someone to find when they are going through my files after I kick the bucket in a fight with, like, a dishwasher or something.</p>
            <p>Only downside to publishing; now I'm kinda gonna feel like I'm writing for an audience, and that affects the writings in its own way. The journal page isn't quite as free flowing of a place as it might have been before
                there was an audience to publish to. The words are chosen a bit more carefully, some things are ommitted, xyz. Maybe I'll write an original idea in the local files on my laptop
                and then give it a day or two before doing an editorial pass and uploading.</p>
            <p>But that's a discussion for another day. For now, I'm publishing this thing. And lord knows there is a lot of HTML I still have to learn, and I need to learn some CSS 
                to make it so these aren't just "whitespace + word" pages that could bore even the most literate literary enthusiasts (who probably would hate this anyways because
                I am far from the next [insert name of great writer here because I don't read, and there's thing #2 for them to hate about my BS]).
                <br>
                That is to say, I know and feel how garbage this site is. Believe me.
                <br>
                With each page I publish, I know it is utterly amateurish and probably a primary example of what people mean when they say,
                <br>
                <i>"Baby's first website."</i></p>
            <p>But I kind of think that's okay.</p>
            <br  />
            <h2>My plan for right now with this cite...</h2>
                <p>Is to expand it with the expansion of my own knowledge (he says, praying his one semester of Introduction to Comp. Sci. and enough hours reading over
                    the tutorial courses on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3 Schools' website</a> will allow him to properly learn HTML and CSS).
                    <br>
                    As I learn more about HTML and CSS, pages will start to look better and more complex, and if I get too carried away, well... 
                    <br>
                    If I have readers, hopefully they'll fill me in!</p>
                <p>Point being, this is an iterative process;
                    the site will evolve as my abilities evolve, either changing in appearance entirely or becoming a little sort of time capsule overview of the journey I have taken
                    from "I have no clue what I'm doing," to "I still have about not a single clue what I'm doing, but here's a website with some pages and a functional menu."</p>
                    <br>
                    Time will tell.
                </p>
            <h2>So what's up with the title of this page? Another arbitrary "it was 3 A.M." thing, or...?</h2>
            <p>No, this one actually has some substance.
                <br>
                One of my primary methods of self-soothing is to listen to a song I like on loop. If the song is slow enough or quiet enough, I can even write to it
                <br>
                <i>(generally, it is difficult for me to listen to music and write simultaneously).</i>
                Today, while working on the website, the new "non-journal page" I will be publishing sometime in the next week, and then this journal entry,
                I have been listening to 
                <br>
                <a href="https://katiedey.bandcamp.com/">Katie Dey's</a> song <a href="https://katiedey.bandcamp.com/track/the-kraken-2" target="_blank">The Kraken</a>.</p> 
                <p>I first heard this song on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOEaUD82GlI">Jacob Geller video essay</a><i> (I'm sure I will be rambling about how much I love his channel at some point in the future)</i>
                and have loved it since. So today, seeking some calm while I worked, I turned it on and looped it.</p>
                <br  />
                <br  />
                <p>I don't know the reason behind it, but something behind looping a paceing, pensive, layered song ad infinitum and allowing it to become your white noise
                is quite wonderful. 
                <br>
                I quite adore it</p>
                <br  />
