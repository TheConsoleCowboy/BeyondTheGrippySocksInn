    In focus is one tree, curving left and upward, the white yellow sunlight silouhetting it. 
    Just right of it, but much further back, 
    is a building with a tall, pointed, rectangular tower on the left side 
    and attached to a shorter (only slightly) and wider rectangular structure."

    <p>This is an old fucking picture, but again,
    <br>
    as I wrote when I was fucking around with HTML for the first time,
    <br>
    maybe it is about time to go back to these hills.</p>
    <br  />
    <p>Oddly enough, coding... or, I guess <i>learning</i> to code (better than I, Mr. 
        "honestly still has no clue what half the stuff on his phone is supposed to do,"
        up until this point, have known to), has been my solace in the midst of all this.</p>
    <p>I have sat at this laptop until the "wee hours" of the morning and obsessively clicked away
        at the keyboard, writing amateurish HTML and markdown on 
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a> and 
        <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>, respectively. 
        And... I don't know, in some ways, it makes me feel a little bit better. 
        I am starting to like building things digitally. Granted, I am still self-admittedly
        at the, "if this is where amateurs sit, then you are somewhere in that vacant lot over there, the one
        all the way across town from here, you know, by the <a href="https://www.dennys.com/" target="_blank">Denny's</a>?" stage.</p>
    <p>But something about building a pseudo-tangible <b>thing</b> that can hold the ramblings...</p>
    <br  />
    <p>Well, maybe it's what I need right now.</p>
    <br  />
    <p>Stay tuned tomorrow, if I get around to it, for 
        <a href="https://theconsolecowboy.github.io/BeyondTheGrippySocksInn/The_Living_Journal/6_January_2023.html">
            I'm not a journal entry! You're a journal entry
        </a>, or what have you. Note to self, need more whiskey.
