    <h1>6 January 2023</h1>
    <p>I was honestly quite prepared for this date to be a day <i>(if not a week, if not a month, if not six months, if not a year, blah blah,
        you get the bit)</i> later than it is - </p>
    <p>Actually, technically, I believe it is... Technically, it's already the 7th, but I haven't slept since, like, 10:30 A.M. on the 6th,
        so I would argue it still counts as the same day.</p>
    <p>Missing someone will do that to you, keep you up until the latest hours, hours you haven't been up to since the last time you were deep in
        a major depressive hole. But... well, if the person meant that much, maybe this time you aren't necessarily back on all the same bullshit 
        you've always been on before... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maybe this time you are not desperately scouring various voice chat apps looking to get off with some random.</li>
        <li>Maybe this time you are not seeking to hook up with one of your friends
            <i>(and failing because it's a horrible, pathetic, and unkind thing to do)</i></li>
        <li>Admittedly, this time, you still are reaching out to old friends that you wouldn't if person XYZ were still around...</li>
        <li>And yes, you are still using porn to numb the bad feelings.</li>
        <li>But at least this time, <b><i>the porn is making you a bit sick</i></b></li>
        <li>And the reaching out is done to make amends rather than restart up that whole, 
            "friends because eventually I want to sleep with you," schtick.</li>
        <li>Because, let's face it, maybe this time you're actually choosing to feel like you lost someone really fucking special
            rather than trying every spiraling method under the sun to forget that you did.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Whatever the case, my point is this:
        <br>
        The right person makes you want to stop being such a piece of shit even after they're gone.
        <br>
        Because they showed you what home could look like with the right person next to you and how much more peaceful it can be than 
        the world that your, "fuck, you can <b>barely function</b> on a <b>good day</b>," brain can barely handle...</p>
    <p>Because one time they said to you,
        <br>
        "You know, I notice that whenever we're at your house, you're so cheerful and silly and light and easy going, but then when we're out
        in the world, you're really on edge and tense..."
        <br>
        And then they said to you, in that voice that always kind of bothered you a bit because it felt patronizing
        <br>
        <i>(Because when your brain is looking to identify any way that things could be wrong, it will sell you the most convincing bullshit)</i> -
        <br>
            but really it was just her way of holding you with her words because it wasn't always the easiest for her to do it with that closing of space
            between you two... even if she still wanted to but just didn't know how yet...
    </p>
    <p>She would say in that voice, "You just need to feel safe... that's all. You just want to feel safe."</p>
    <p>And I would give anything to just tell her, make sure she knows...</p>
    <br  />
    <p>Despite how anxious I seemed with all the fear that uncontrollable jealousy brings, 
        <br>
        for all the ways having someone to lose can make you terrified to lose them, 
        <br>
        for all the ways I overread every situation, 
        <br>
        for how hard it was to be away from her...</p>
    <br  />
    And for how bad I was at handling that pandamonium inside my head.
    <p>There really was nothing safer than a moment spent with her, just hearing every captivating thought she had say, 
        and knowing I had at long last found home.</p>
    <br  />
    <p>Just to practice HTML stuff a little bit more, two things</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Earlier, when I was typing out the unordered list, 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMpSQV1-bsA" target="_blank">this song from Cabaret</a>
            was playing in my head.</li>
        <li>Read the caption on the next one, eh? (IYKYK)</li>
    </ol>

        alt="I'm not going to post a picture of person XYZ. I don't think it would really be respectful of her privacy. Instead
            I'm posting a picture of some pals she lovingly used to call The Bears. My bears. She knew I loved them. The bigger, medium brown 
            one, with the little beige paw pads, and the smaller, beige one, with the little medium brown paw pads. I reckon by the end,
            she loved them just about as much as I did. She even made the little one that red cap. He's still wearing it right now. I honestly couldn't
            get him to part with it, though truthfully, I did not try very hard. And I think one day, maybe I'll make him a 
            scarf to go with it. And, perhaps, in a sense, it can be something I will share with her."
