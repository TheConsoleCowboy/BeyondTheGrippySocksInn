        <h1><b>The Better Man Manifesto</b></h1>
        <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeblJdB2-Vo" target="_blank">What we practice <b>manifests</b></a>. What is it you want to manifest?</h2>
        <p>Work towards your strengths, <b>share what you have to offer</b>
            <br>
            In service with <b>no ask for compensation</b>.
            <br>
            Do not make life a grueling competition;
            <br>
            Instead, <b>collaborate</b> towards something better,
            <br>
            And <b>leave the park <a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2013/03/the-universal-rules-of-civilized-discourse/">much cleaner than when we found it</a></b>.</p>
            
        <p><b>Face conflict with your mind</b>, not with your fists,
            <br>
            But know how to <b>protect</b> those faced with harm,
            <br>
            And how to take the world's blunt, bruising strikes, 
            <br>
            On their behalf or yours, and <b>keep your footing</b>.
            <br>
            For no plan survives contact with reality.</p>
        <p><b>Hold fast to your beliefs</b>, though they may change, 
            <br>
            For they are, in the end, your cornerstone;
            <br>
            But in your understanding of yourself,
            <br>
            <b>Do not condemn or damn the views of others</b>:</p>
        <p>For we should <b>love through learning</b> others' minds, 
            <br>            
            And, forging good, <b>seek first to understand</b>.</p>
