        <h1>What the hell is <b><i>The Better Man Manifesto?</i></b>...  An Explanation</h1>
        <p>This is in no way, shape, or form an attempt to claim these to be the "ideal
            standards for manhood" or anything of the sort. When I say, "Better Man," I mean
            <b>striving to be a better man today than who I was yesterday.</b></p>
        <p>The inspiration for the name of this page honestly comes from that 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PReSQYTFvcs" target="_blank">Taylor Swift song</a>:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://open.spotify.com/track/1gWRnZ52AK1ZUvpjjTteKf">
                "Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
                <br>
                But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man.""
            </blockquote>
        </p>See, I started this whole project as a way of keeping myself afloat
        when I was awake at 3 A.M. missing someone very dear to me who, let's face it, 
        left because I didn't know how to be grateful for the good thing we had without being
        terrified about it being less than "100% safe." And... well, 
        <br>
        I write a lot of the pages on this site wishing I had been that better man.</p>
        <p>This is the space where I plan to take the work I have been doing on <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>
            (discussed sometimes in my <a href="https://theconsolecowboy.github.io/BeyondTheGrippySocksInn/The_Living_Journal/5_January_2023">living journal</a>) and make sense of what it is to be a "better man." And, in time, I will pair what exists on here with references to 
            either academic or populare press writings; back up the ideas I have with the voices of those whose inputs actually carry some
            weight,
            <br>
            or find that there is a different perspective I should be taking altogether.</p>
        <p id="iterative">After all, these things are <i>iterative</i>, no?</p>
        <p>So, all said, all done, all prefaced out, without further ado:</p>
        <br  />
